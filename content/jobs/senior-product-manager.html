    <h3>About the product</h3>
    <p>
      You will lead a multi-disciplinary team of designers, developers and PMs to build the user experience of applying for a permit. With more than 600 permits, this is a huge undertaking and will have a significant impact on the way residents experience their city government. 
      <br/></br>
      The city gives permits for everything from building new housing, to starting new businesses, to events big and small. Permits help the City make sure that things are happening safely and that we are upholding the values of our communities. 
      <br/></br>
      We have a unique opportunity to improve the permit experience for residents, because a new Permit Center is being built at 49 South Van Ness. This physical space will bring together 11 different departments that are currently spread out all over the city, making an easy one-stop location for all in-person permit transactions. We want to make sure that as much as possible can be done online, before residents show up in person, so that the time of our staff is spent in quality interactions, rather than in repetitive administration work. 
      <br/></br>
      There are several digital products that will make an exceptional Permitting customer experience, including:
    </p>
    <ul class="text-align-left">
      <li>Smart online application forms</li>
      <li>Tools that help people check the city’s rules and fees</li>
      <li>Integrations with many back-office systems used by city staff</li>
      <li>Notifications and status tracking tool</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="roles-body col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
    <h3>About the role</h3>
    <p>
      As the Senior PM for Permitting, you’ll own the vision and strategy for digital permitting and oversee products that give an excellent customer experience. As the top technical authority, you will work with a multi-disciplinary team of 10 or more designers, developers and other PMs, and decide priorities for development across the board. 
      <br/><br/>
      You will engage with permitting departments and customers to understand where there is greatest need and opportunity, and you will own the overall product roadmap for digital permitting. You will get into the detail and complexity of permitting processes, but be able to switch into the high-level view as needed, to make sure the overall vision stays true. 
      <br/><br/>
      Where vendors are involved you will help manage those relationships, and where our team is building products you will ensure this happens in an Agile way. You will define performance measures and reporting, and make sure all permitting efforts are coordinated and communicated. Successful candidates will have leadership experience on agile product teams.
      <br/><br/>
      You will be a champion for user needs, using data and user research to back up your product roadmap. You will manage complexity and stay calm under pressure, balancing competing priorities and backlogs for the best impact on users.
