    <h3>About the team</h3>
    <p>
      The San Francisco Digital Services Team is transforming how residents interact with the City, implementing our Digital Services Strategy through building services designed around the people that use them. Led by the Chief Digital Services Officer, the team is comprised of product managers, designers, business analysts, developers, and content strategists. As a member of this new team, you would be part of a new and growing movement, with an opportunity to shape the City’s approach to design.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re growing the digital services team that maintains and iteratively improves the DAHLIA affordable housing service (housing.sfgov.org), as well as the Salesforce implementation used to manage affordable housing operations. The mission of the Housing Division of the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD) is to provide financing for the development of affordable housing in San Francisco and guide the City's housing policy. MOHCD ensures the  long-term affordability and physical viability of the City's stock of affordable housing. The Office also provides financial and educational assistance to first-time homebuyers, and finances housing rehabilitation costs for low-income homeowners. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The DAHLIA Affordable Housing project allows residents to learn about and apply for affordable housing opportunities in one place. Before the debut of DAHLIA, San Franciscans needed to monitor multiple sources of information for listings and had to fill out a new application for each new development. DAHLIA has also provided Leasing Agents with consistent information and has freed MOHCD staff from needing to manually enter application information.  We think a lot about equity, accessibility, and helping MOHCD succeed in meeting their ever-changing business needs while also getting the data they need. We conduct user testing to make sure we’re building things that are important to and really work for residents. There are many other functions of the housing process that we haven’t yet started working on, and we are looking forward to building these in the coming years.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to work on products that positively affect the lives of your users, and are interested in being part of a department that is a thought leader in government, then this job is for you.

    <h3>About the role</h3>
    <p>
      We are looking for a front end designer to join the digital services team that helps people find and apply for affordable housing opportunities in San Francisco. You will be working closely and collaborating with the Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD) and community partners to administer this process. This product launched in 2015 and has already earned acclaim, including winning the <a href="https://www.spur.org/news/2018-03-27/good-government-awards-2018-dahlia-housing-portal-transformed-how-san-franciscans">2018 Good Government Award</a>. We maintain the existing products, and over time will be working with MOHCD to decide what services to build next.
    </p>
    <p>
      This role requires the ability to deliver HTML and CSS, broad experience in UX design, and some background in user testing and research. You will be working from an existing pattern library. As the housing team’s designer you will have an important role in continuing to uphold the high design bar we have set for housing.sfgov.org.  
    </p>    
    <p>
      You will help conduct research by creating test scripts, and produce interactive prototypes to get feedback from users.  You will take the findings from user testing and analytics to iterate and improve on the product, working closely with front-end developers and stakeholders to share your findings and design decisions. Your research will help the team identify what epics we will work on in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’ll collaborate with MOHCD staff to meet additional needs of housing applicants, and rethink non-digital service avenues in order to improve the customer experience. You will work with your digital service design colleagues, which include UX Designers, Service Designers and Content Designers,  to provide design critiques. Together you will continue to set the standard of best practices within the Digital Services design team.
