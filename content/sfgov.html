        <p>San Francisco, the heart of technology, innovation, and progressive values, needs a website worthy of that legacy.</p>

        <p>Right now, we have 210 websites across the City with over 300,000 pages. But getting services from the City is frequently difficult and confusing. With so much information, residents don’t know which pages to trust.  They might have to visit multiple sites to accomplish a task.</p>
        
        <p>San Francisco offers more than 800 services, but only 20% of them can be done online. We can do better.</p>
          
        <p>It’s time for San Francisco to join the digital world. We’re making it happen and here’s how.</p>

        <p>
          <img src="/assets/sfgov/mobile.png" />
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <strong>It's very, very user-friendly</strong><br/>
          Our new website will make it easier for San Franciscans to get City services online, simply and directly. Every page offers a service in the fewest possible steps, carefully designed by experts who’ve spent their professional lives making it easier to get things done online. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>It works for everyone, literally</strong><br/>
          The site will meet Federal standards for accessibility and readability. Our font is clear and legible and legally compliant with ADA and Section 508 for people with disabilities. Our writing guidelines ensure consistency and simplicity, so screenreaders and people can read faster. A 5th grade reading level means it’s easy for everyone to understand and translate.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>It speaks your language</strong><br/>
          Every service page and department homepage will be translated into Chinese (traditional), Spanish, and Filipino, by human translators. All other pages will be translated by machine. We’re working with the Language Access team to make sure we have automatic, high-quality translations. Departments won’t need to procure separate translations for their web content. We are testing the translations and the site with people who don’t speak English as their first language.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>It’s designed for much more than looks</strong><br/>
          The modern color palette was chosen for vivid contrasts, making them easier to visually interpret. Color blocks and a scalable color palette keep visuals fresh and fun without relying on photos. We limited photos because we don’t want to waste San Franciscan’s data plans on images.

            <strong>It’s made for SF</strong><br/>
            It represents the City’s diversity. The equal sign hidden in the SF symbol reflects our progressive values. It celebrates our unique culture of radical inclusivity. We got feedback and insight from more than 250 residents, community groups and City staff on our design, content and usability.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            <strong>It’s official</strong><br/>
            Our City seal shows residents that they are on an official City site. Residents have told us the seal helps them know they are in the right place. 
          </p>
  
          <p>
            <strong>It's unified</strong><br/>
            We're bringing the City's departments under one site to give San Franciscans a consistent and streamlined experience. Residents told us they want a website that they know is official and reliable. Our clean design is distinctive but also flexible for a wide variety of content.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            <strong>A 2-website System</strong><br/>
            We’re not finished building the new site. So you will see old and new pages linking to each other for some time. We’ll add banners on both sites to help users navigate. We’re talking to San Franciscans to find out how the banners can best help them navigate.

        <p>We need your help to build the new site. Right now, we’re working with a few departments to write new pages, putting the user first by making services easy to navigate. We’re moving some services, news, and events. The focus is on services for San Franciscans so our first priority is departments that offer services to the public.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>An easy way to get started</strong><br/>
          We want to represent all departments that offer services to the public on the new website. So even if you aren't moving any content yet, we want your department listed with a link to your current website.
        </p>

        <p>For that listing, we need from you:</p>
        <ul class="left-aligned">
          <li>the title of your department</li>
          <li>a summary of what your department does (under 110 characters)</li>
          <li>current website URL</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Get in touch with our content strategist, <a href="mailto:persis.howe@sfgov.org">persis.howe@sfgov.org</a>, to talk about how your department might look on the new site.
