        <p>We’re developing a new website that will make it easier for San Franciscans to get a birth certificate, register a business, and get a marriage license. It’s not meant to represent the 300+ websites the City currently has, but to serve all San Franciscans, simply and directly.</p>

        <p>Many other big cities and even the UK government are doing this too—bringing services together based on resident’s needs and putting them first, with services that are clear, simple, and easy to use so people can do they things we know they want to.</p>
          
        <p>Feedback and insight from more than 300 residents, community groups and City staff informs our design, testing, and changes. We’ve heard:</p>

          <li class="margin-bottom-25">“The City of SF should have a website that reflects its own personality”</li>

          We’re working with a few departments to move their services, information, news, events and department homepages to the new website. We’ll build more pieces of the site soon, but for right now we’re focused on services for San Franciscans. We have prioritized departments that offer services and also provided us insight from all levels of staff.

        <ul>
          <li>the title of your department</li>
          <li>a summary of what your department does (under 110 characters)</li>
