            The San Francisco Digital Services Team is transforming how residents interact with the city by building services designed around the people that use them. Led by the Chief Digital Services Officer, the team is comprised of product managers, designers, business analysts, developers, and content strategists. Four fundamental principles guide our task: put the needs of residents first, focus on delivery and outcomes over process, promote an agile and data driven culture, and make City services accessible to everyone. We have some exciting and high-profile products in our pipeline, including re-building the city’s website from the ground up, affordable housing applications, and registering new cannabis businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            In these roles, you'll help change culture and practices, as well as roll your sleeves up for hands-on work on the development, operation, and ongoing improvement of complex digital services. As a member of this new team, you’d have an opportunity to shape the City’s approach to digital services.
