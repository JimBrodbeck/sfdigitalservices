          <p>As the Innovation Capital of the world, San Francisco is a vibrant beautiful city that is one of the world’s foremost cultural, commercial, and financial centers.  San Francisco provides a broad range of services to residents and visitors.</p>
          <p>San Francisco does a lot of things well, but like most places, we know that San Francisco has its own challenges. We know that we can do a better job of listening to you, our customers. To do this better, we are creating a central Digital Services Team, as well as Digital Services teams within major agencies, to transform how the City provides services to those that work, live, and play in San Francisco.</p>
          <p>Technologists who join this effort will lead the City & County of San Francisco into the digital age, modernizing how we interact with residents citywide. Four fundamental principles guide this task: put the needs of residents first, focus on delivery and outcomes over process, promote an agile and data driven culture, and make City services accessible to everyone.</p>
          <p>In these roles, you'll help change culture and practices, as well as roll your sleeves up for hands-on work on the development, operation, and ongoing improvement of complex digital services.</p>
